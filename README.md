This repository accompanies the article "[How To Implement Custom Error Responses in Express](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-implement-custom-error-responses-in-expressjs/)".

It contains a modified version of a code sample, which is part of the ["Auth0 Developer Hub"](https://auth0.com/developers/hub), a place where you can explore the authentication and authorization features of the Auth0 Identity Platform.



Visit the ["Express.js/JavaScript Authorization: API Role-Based Access Control"](https://auth0.com/developers/hub/code-samples/api/express-javascript/basic-role-based-access-control) page for instructions on how to configure and run this code sample and how to integrate it with a Single-Page Application (SPA) of your choice.
